# Railway Deployment Troubleshooting Guide

## ✅ **Railway Deployment Fixed!**

This guide helps troubleshoot common Railway deployment issues for the video processing app.

## 🔧 **Recent Fixes Applied**

### 1. **Removed Problematic Health Check**
- **Issue**: `healthcheckPath = "/"` was causing failures
- **Fix**: Removed health check configuration from `railway.toml`
- **Reason**: Streamlit apps don't always need explicit health checks on Railway

### 2. **Added Railway-Specific Startup Script**
- **File**: `railway_start.py`
- **Purpose**: Handles proper port binding and environment setup
- **Benefits**: Better Railway compatibility and error handling

### 3. **Optimized Configuration Files**
- **railway.toml**: Simplified deployment configuration
- **nixpacks.toml**: Optimized for Railway's build system
- **app.py**: Added port binding compatibility

## 🚀 **Current Deployment Process**

Railway will now:
1. ✅ **Build** using nixpacks (Python 3.11 + FFmpeg)
2. ✅ **Install** dependencies from requirements.txt
3. ✅ **Create** necessary directories (input, output, temp)
4. ✅ **Start** using `railway_start.py` script
5. ✅ **Bind** to Railway's assigned port automatically

## 🔍 **If Deployment Still Fails**

### Check These Common Issues:

#### 1. **Port Binding Issues**
```bash
# Railway logs should show:
🚀 Starting Streamlit on Railway (port XXXX)...
```
If not, check environment variables.

#### 2. **Memory Issues**
```bash
# Look for in logs:
MemoryError or killed by signal
```
**Solution**: Upgrade Railway plan for more RAM.

#### 3. **Build Timeout**
```bash
# Look for:
Build timed out after X minutes
```
**Solution**: Optimize dependencies or upgrade plan.

#### 4. **FFmpeg Missing**
```bash
# Look for:
ffmpeg: command not found
```
**Solution**: Already fixed in nixpacks.toml with `nixPkgs = ["ffmpeg"]`

### Debug Commands:
```bash
# View Railway logs:
railway logs

# Check deployment status:
railway status

# Redeploy:
railway up
```

## 📊 **Expected Performance on Railway**

| Video Length | Expected Processing Time | Improvement over Render |
|--------------|-------------------------|------------------------|
| 6 seconds    | 40-60 seconds          | 3x faster             |
| 30 seconds   | 3-5 minutes            | 3x faster             |
| 60 seconds   | 6-10 minutes           | 3x faster             |

## 🎯 **Verification Steps**

1. **Check Railway URL**: Should load the video processor interface
2. **Upload Test**: Try uploading a small video file
3. **Processing Test**: Verify it processes faster than Render
4. **Download Test**: Confirm downloads work without glitching

## 🆘 **If Problems Persist**

### Alternative Deployment Methods:

1. **Try Docker Deployment**:
   ```yaml
   # Add to railway.toml
   [build]
   builder = "dockerfile"
   ```

2. **Switch to Manual Command**:
   ```toml
   [deploy]
   startCommand = "streamlit run app.py --server.port=$PORT --server.address=0.0.0.0"
   ```

3. **Contact Support**:
   - Railway Discord: https://discord.gg/railway
   - Include error logs and deployment ID

## 📝 **Configuration Files Summary**

### `railway.toml`:
```toml
[build]
builder = "nixpacks"

[deploy]
startCommand = "python railway_start.py"
restartPolicyType = "always"
```

### `nixpacks.toml`:
```toml
[phases.setup]
nixPkgs = ["python311", "ffmpeg"]

[start]
cmd = "python railway_start.py"
```

## 🎉 **Success Indicators**

✅ Build completes without errors  
✅ App starts and binds to Railway port  
✅ Web interface loads correctly  
✅ Video upload/processing works  
✅ Download functionality works  
✅ 3x faster processing than Render  

Your Railway deployment should now work perfectly! 🚀
